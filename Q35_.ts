// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

let animalName = ["cow", "sheep", "goat", "cammels"];
// printing only names

for(let i of animalName){
console.log(i);

}
for(let j of animalName){
    console.log(`${j} is a Domestic animal`);
}
console.log(`all these animals' ${animalName[0]}, ${animalName[1]}, ${animalName[2]} and ${animalName[3]} meat is halal in Islam` );
